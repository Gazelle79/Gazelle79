### :octocat: __I'm Frederick.__ :octocat:

__I'm an experieced developer, mainly with Linux, Java, C# & Python.__ My recent work is back-end, but I'm very comfortable with full stack development. I'm a fan of:

- [x] World football ⚽ 
- [x] Distance running / world track & field 🎽
- [x] Animation 🖋️
- [x] Lifting 🏋️
- [x] Unit testing 💻 (It testing saves lives.)

### :key: My values

- Solving any problem == asking the _right questions_ before writing __any__ code.
- Taking time & thought to design software properly at the start == __NOT__ rewriting __EVERYTHING__ later.
- Unit testing saves lives.
- Well written code should flow as smoothly as paragraphs on a page. 
- Good communication is __just as important__ as well-written software.
- __Knowing a language > knowing a framework.__ If I know a language, I can learn any framework that uses it.
- Frameworks change. Fundamentals don't.
