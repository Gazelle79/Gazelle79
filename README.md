I'm a software developer developer, mainly with Linux, Java, C# & Python. Much of my work is back-end, but I can do full stack development. I'm a fan of world football :soccer:, distance running :sparkles:, animation :pen:, and unit testing :computer:. Unit testing saves lives.

### My values

- Solving any problem starts with asking the _right_ questions.
- Taking more time to design software properly at the start means you won't REWRITE EVERYTHING later.
- Unit testing saves lives.
- Well written code should flow as easily as paragraphs on a page. 
- Good communication is just as important as well-written software.
- If I know a language, I can learn any framework that uses it. I prioritize knowing a language over a framework.
 
 ### Main languages / Operating systems
