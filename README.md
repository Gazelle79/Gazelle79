I'm a software developer developer by trade, mainly with Linux, Java, C# & Python. Much of my work is back-end code, but I can do full stack development. I'm a fan of world football, distance running, animation, and unit testing. Unit testing saves lives.

### My values

- Solving any problem starts with asking the _right_ questions.
- Taking more time to lay out / design software properly at the start means you won't REWRITE EVERYTHING later.
- Unit testing saves lives.
- Well written code should flow as easily as paragraphs in a book. 
- Good communication is just as important as well-written software.
- If I know a language, I can learn any framework surrounding it. I put more emphasis on knowing a language because of that.
 
 ### Main languages / Operating systems

- `Java`
- `C#`
- `Python`
- `Linux (Mint, CentOs, Ubuntu)`
- `Windows 10`
- `XML`


 ### Frameworks

- `Django`
- `Asp.Net` (moving away from this)
- `Spring boot` (very new to it, not willing to put on resume)
