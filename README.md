I'm a software developer developer by trade, mainly with Linux, Java, C# & Python. Much of my work is back-end code, but I can do full stack development. I'm a fan of world football, distance running, animation, and unit testing. Unit testing saves lives.

### My values

 - All knowledge starts with asking the right questions.
 - Taking more time to lay out / design software properly at the start means you won't everything later.
 - Unit testing saves lives.
 - Well written code should flow as easily as paragraphs in a book. 
 - Good communication is just as important as well-written software. 
 
 ### Main languages / Operating systems

 - Java
 - C#
 - Python
 - Linux (Mint, CentOs, Ubuntu)
 - Windows 10
