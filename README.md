### :octocat: __I'm Frederick.__ :octocat:

__I'm a developer developer, mainly with Linux, Java, C# & Python.__ Much of my work is back-end, but I can do full stack development. I'm a fan of world football :soccer:, distance running :sparkles:, animation :pen:, and unit testing :computer:. Unit testing saves lives.

### :key: My values

- Solving any problem means asking the _right questions_ before there's a single line of code.
- Take more time to design software properly at the start. You won't have to rewrite EVERYTHING later.
- Unit testing saves lives.
- Well written code should flow as easily as paragraphs on a page. 
- Good communication is just as important as well-written software.
- Knowing a language > knowing a framework. If I know a language, I can learn any framework that uses it.
- Frameworks change. Fundamentals don't.
